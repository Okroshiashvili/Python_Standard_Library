xml.etree.ElementTree also supports creating well-formed XML documents
from Element objects constructed in an application.


There are three helper functions useful for creating a hierarchy of Element nodes.
"Element()" creates a standard node, "SubElement()" attaches a new node to a parent,
and "Comment()" creates a node that serializes using XMLâ€™s comment syntax.
